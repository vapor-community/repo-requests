# Vapor Requests

This is a list of repositories and features that people would like to see in Vapor. They could be minor features or major repositories.

The idea is that the community can join together, work on them and contribute to the Vapor ecosystem.

## Requests

* DynamoDB driver (potentially on top of Fluent)
* AdminPanel
* AWS (S3, Route53, EC2 etc.)
* Kafka driver
* SocketIO support

## Contributing
